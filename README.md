# JewelrystoreEDAandPrediction
We embark on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) journey to gain insights into the factors influencing sales trends and patterns. We aim to uncover valuable information that allows us to develop a predictive model for daily sales. This analysis will provide the jewelry store with actionable insights, empowering them to optimize business operations.
